## Regression Analysis: Impact of Minimum Wage Policies on Youth Unemployment in Pakistan   from a Living Wage Perspective
The employment effects of minimum wages remain a debated issue since the evidence is mixed. Some studies conclude large negative estimates for employment elasticity, some occasional positive estimates, and others conclude employment elasticities of low-skilled groups to be zero. With rising poverty and income inequality in developing countries, labor economics is now more focused upon the link between statutory minimum wages and employment of low-skilled workers, as it provides a means to formulate better-informed policy decisions. Additionally, economists are now shifting to living wage ordinances as a means to improve working and living conditions of workers. This study will be an attempt to analyze what impact minimum wage has upon youth unemployment in Pakistan, a country having the world's ninth largest labor force, with 4 million young people reaching working age each year, and how it compares to the required living wage. The results of this study will have an important bearing and will help redesign labor policies that have maximum impact upon the income and living standards of low-skilled workers.
